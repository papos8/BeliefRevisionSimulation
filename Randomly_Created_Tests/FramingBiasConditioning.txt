Compare unbiased conditioning and framing bias conditioning.
First states and observables are created and then the plausibility orders of the agents.
The two agents have the same plausibility orders, but different stubbornness degrees. 

200 randomly created tests will be generated and the success percentage will be displayed in the end.
