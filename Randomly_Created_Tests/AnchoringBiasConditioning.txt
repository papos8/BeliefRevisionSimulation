Compare unbiased conditioning and anchoring bias conditioning.
In these tests we also compare when the two methods idenitfy the actual world to see if anchoring bias conditioning is faster than unbiased conditionin.
First states and observables are created and then the plausibility orders of the agents.
The two agents have the same plausibility orders, but different stubbornness degrees. 

200 randomly created tests will be generated and the success percentage will be displayed in the end.
